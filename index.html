    <h1><code>ÅOP calculator</code> — a multi purpose ÅOP calculator</h1>
    <p>This project is an multi purpose ÅOP calculator developed to set a
        reference for testing
        loan application flows at Santander Consumer Bank.</p>
    <p>The calculator has been verified against many live scenarios but no
        warranty for correctness is given.
        Use of the calculator results will be at own risk.</p>
    <p>In general terms ÅOP is equivalent to IRR - internal rate of return.
        ÅOP is the rate at which the net present value of a cashflow (payments including all costs) becomes zero.
        The rate is ‘internal’ because it does not take any external factor (like inflation) into consideration.</p>
    <p>In this project all calculation functions are placed in the file calc.js.
        If you are looking for inspiration how to calculate ÅOP you should just focus on this file, as all the rest of
        this project are files needed for supporting the aopjs test calculator on the web.</p>
    <p>Either way feel free to comment on the project or even suggest changes or improvements.</p>
    <p>Enjoy,<br>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get you started you can simply clone the <code>aopjs</code> repository
        and install the dependencies:</p>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>You need git to clone the <code>aopjs</code> repository. You can get git
        from <a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
    <p>We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test
        <code>aopjs</code>. You must have Node.js
        and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from <a href="https://nodejs.org/"
                                                                          rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Clone <code>aopjs</code></h3>
    <p>Clone the <code>aopjs</code> repository using git:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>git clone https://github.com/mmeilby/aopjs.git
cd aopjs</code></pre>
    <p>If you just want to start a new project without the <code>aopjs</code>
        commit history then you can do:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mmeilby/aopjs.git &lt;your-project-name&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>depth=1</code> tells git to only pull down one commit worth of
        historical data.</p>
    <h3>Install Dependencies</h3>
    <p>We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and AngularJS
        framework code. The tools
        help us manage and test the application.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We get the tools we depend upon and the AngularJS code via <code>npm</code>, the <a
                href="https://www.npmjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Node package manager</a>.
        </li>
        <li>In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
            <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit" rel="nofollow">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a>
            installed on your machine. Check out the section on end-to-end testing for more info.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have preconfigured <code>npm</code> to automatically copy the downloaded
        AngularJS files to <code>app/lib</code> so we can simply do:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm install</code></pre>
    <p>Behind the scenes this will also call <code>npm run copy-libs</code>, which
        copies the AngularJS files and
        other front end dependencies. After that, you should find out that you have two new directories in
        your project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>node_modules</code> - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>app/lib</code> - contains the AngularJS framework files and other front end dependencies
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note copying the AngularJS files from <code>node_modules</code> to
        <code>app/lib</code> makes it easier to serve the
        files by a web server.</em></p>
    <h3>Run the Application</h3>
    <p>We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The
        simplest way to start
        this server is:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm start</code></pre>
    <p>Now browse to the app at <a href="http://localhost:8000/index.html"
                                   rel="nofollow"><code>localhost:8000/aopjs/app</code></a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>There are two kinds of tests in the <code>aopjs</code> application: Unit
        tests and end-to-end tests.</p>
    <h3>Running Unit Tests</h3>
    <p>The <code>aopjs</code> app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are
        written in <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Jasmine</a>,
        which we run with the <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Karma</a> test runner. We provide
        a Karma configuration file to run them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The configuration is found at <code>karma.conf.js</code>.</li>
        <li>The unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have a
            <code>.spec.js</code> suffix (e.g.
            <code>view1.spec.js</code>).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm
        script:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm test</code></pre>
    <p>This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests.
        Moreover, Karma will start
        watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
        changes.
        This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
        you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.</p>
    <p>You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This
        is useful if you want to
        check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a
        predefined script to do this:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm run test-single-run</code></pre>
    <p><a name="user-content-e2e-testing"></a></p>
    <h3>Running End-to-End Tests</h3>
    <p>The <code>aopjs</code> app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in <a
            href="https://jasmine.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Jasmine</a>. These tests
        are run with the <a href="http://www.protractortest.org/" rel="nofollow">Protractor</a> End-to-End test runner.
        It uses native events and has special features for AngularJS applications.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The configuration is found at <code>e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js</code>.</li>
        <li>The end-to-end tests are found in <code>e2e-tests/scenarios.js</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the
        application responds
        correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can
        interact with it.</p>
    <p><strong>Before starting Protractor, open a separate terminal window and run:</strong></p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm start</code></pre>
    <p>In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver, we need to ensure
        that it is installed and
        up-to-date. The <code>aopjs</code> project is configured to do this automatically before running the
        end-to-end tests, so you don't need to worry about it. If you want to manually update the WebDriver,
        you can run:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm run update-webdriver</code></pre>
    <p>Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our
        application is up and running, you
        can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm run protractor</code></pre>
    <p>This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being
        hosted on the
        development server.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>
        Under the hood, Protractor uses the <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/" rel="nofollow">Selenium Standalone
            Server</a>, which in turn requires
        the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit" rel="nofollow">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> to
        be installed on your local machine. Check this by running
        <code>java -version</code> from the command line.</p>
    <p>If JDK is not already installed, you can download it <a
            href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Updating AngularJS and other dependencies</h2>
    <p>Since the AngularJS framework library code and tools are acquired through
        package managers (e.g.
        npm) you can use these tools to easily update the dependencies. Simply run the preconfigured script:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm run update-deps</code></pre>
    <p>This will call <code>npm update</code> and <code>npm run copy-libs</code>,
        which in turn will find and install the latest
        versions that match the version ranges specified in the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
    <p>If you want to update a dependency to a version newer than what the
        specificed range would permit,
        you can change the version range in <code>package.json</code> and then run <code>npm run update-deps</code> as
        usual.</p>
    <h2>Loading AngularJS Asynchronously</h2>
    <p>The <code>aopjs</code> project supports loading the framework and
        application scripts asynchronously.
        The special <code>index-async.html</code> is designed to support this style of loading. For it to work you must
        inject a piece of AngularJS JavaScript into the HTML page. The project has a predefined script to help
        do this:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>npm run update-index-async</code></pre>
    <p>This will copy the contents of the <code>angular-loader.js</code> library
        file into the <code>index-async.html</code>
        page. You can run this every time you update the version of AngularJS that you are using.</p>
    <h2>Serving the Application Files</h2>
    <p>While AngularJS is client-side-only technology and it is possible to create
        AngularJS web apps that
        do not require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
        web server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
        sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, XHR,
        etc to function properly when an HTML page is opened via the <code>file://</code> scheme instead of <code>http://</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Running the App during Development</h3>
    <p>The <code>aopjs</code> project comes preconfigured with a local development
        web server. It is a Node.js
        tool called <a href="https://github.com/indexzero/http-server">http-server</a>. You can start this web server
        with <code>npm start</code>, but you may
        choose to install the tool globally:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>sudo npm install -g http-server</code></pre>
    <p>Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files
        from any folder by running:</p>
    <pre class="alert alert-dark" role="alert"><code>http-server -a localhost -p 8000</code></pre>
    <p>Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own web server, such as
        Apache or Nginx. Just
        configure your server to serve the files under the <code>app/</code> directory.</p>
    <h3>Running the App in Production</h3>
    <p>This really depends on how complex your app is and the overall
        infrastructure of your system, but
        the general rule is that all you need in production are the files under the <code>app/</code> directory.
        Everything else should be omitted.</p>
    <p>AngularJS apps are really just a bunch of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript
        files that need to be
        hosted somewhere they can be accessed by browsers.</p>
    <p>If your AngularJS app is talking to the backend server via XHR or other
        means, you need to figure
        out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
        applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
        reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and web server(s).</p>
    <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
    <h3>Travis CI</h3>
    <p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/" rel="nofollow">Travis CI</a> is a
        continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits to
        your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The <code>aopjs</code>
        project contains a Travis configuration file, <code>.travis.yml</code>, which will cause Travis to run your
        tests when you push to GitHub.</p>
    <p>You will need to enable the integration between Travis and GitHub. See the
        <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started" rel="nofollow">Travis website</a> for instructions on
        how to do this.</p>
